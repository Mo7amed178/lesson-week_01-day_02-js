Problem 1




problem 2:

var currYear = 2019;
var BYear = 1994;
var totalAge = currYear - BYear

console.log ( "Your old is " + totalAge + " or " + (totalAge - 1) + "!!");

output :
Your old is 25 or 24!!

problem 3 :

var currAge = 25;
var maxAge = 90;
var amountPerDay = 3;
var total = maxAge - currAge;
var totalAmount = total * amountPerDay;

console.log ("You will need " + totalAmount + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge );

out put : 
You will need 195 to last you until the ripe old age of 90


problem 4:

part 1:

var radius = 5;
var circumference = 2 * radius * 3.14;

console.log("The circumference is " + circumference );

output :
The circumference is 31.400000000000002


part 2:

var radius = 5;
var area = (5 * 5) * 3.14;

console.log("The area is " + area );

output:
The area is 78.5


problem 5 :

var celsius = 10;
var fahrenheit = 50;

var conToFahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
var conToCelsius = ( fahrenheit - 32 ) * 9/5;
console.log( celsius + "C is " + conToFahrenheit +"F");
console.log( fahrenheit +"F is " + conToCelsius +"C");

output :

10C is 50F
50F is 32.4C
